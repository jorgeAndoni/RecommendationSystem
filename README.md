## Datasets
In this work, a movie review database was used. The database consists of 3,974 users and 3,564 movies. In total, the database has 539,754 reviews, where ratings are given on a 5-star scale.

## Main results
The evaluation of recommendation systems enables us to determine algorithm efficiency and objectively compare the performance of one system with others. For the purposes of this study, we employed the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) metric. Additionally, assessing the training time for each algorithm to predict user preferences proved significant. This evaluation, accounting for both time and efficiency, holds importance as certain algorithms may be swift but lack strong performance. Conversely, some algorithms may demand substantial training time yet yield excellent outcomes. In the following figures, I present the evaluation of various recommendation system methods, considering both RMSE metrics and execution time.
